        owner must take care of a kennel that will provide him with protection from the weather, whether in the hot

        <h2>History of the boxer dogs</h2>
        <p>A Boxer dog is a cross between a German Bullenbeisser, which today is already an extinct breed and is
            actually a descendant of the Mastiff. And the Bullenbeisser was used for hundreds of years as a hunting dog
            and even helped in hunting various wild animals such as bears, wild boars and even deer. The Bullenbeisser's
            job was to catch and hold the prey until the hunter arrived. Over the years, after regional revolutions, the
            Bullenbeisser breed, already stopped functioning as a hunting dog and began to help farmers in guarding and
            restraining the cattle.

            from this litter was the male Lanchers Box which was a dog with yellow-brown fur that is considered the
            ancestor of the Boxer
