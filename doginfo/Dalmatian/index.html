        <h2>A dog that loves to play and loves human company</h2>
        <p>
            The Dalmatian is a smart and very active dog, he needs a lot of activity and play and loves to be in the
            company
            of humans. Without human company this dog may sink into depression. Although this dog loves children very
            much,
            he is not aware of his strength and body size and should be kept in the company of children. You can keep
            the
            Dalmatian dog at home, but on the condition that you take it out for walks and runs. Because he tends to
            chase
            vehicles and bicycles, the area where he is found must be well fenced, okra and part of the day he is in the
            yard.

        <h2>The history of the Dalmatian dog</h2>
        <p>Dalmatian dogs are an ancient breed, which have changed throughout history. According to the information,
            these dogs have existed for more than two thousand years and the exact origin of these dogs is from
            Yugoslavia, but many researchers believe that the breed in general was developed in England from a cross
            between a pointer dog and a bull terrier.
        </p><br>
        Although this is an intelligent, dominant, curious and stubborn dog, his great vigor and natural hunting
        instinct is inherent in him, he may still destroy furniture in the house and even chase cats, but due to his
        hunting instinct and his high intelligence, he is easy to train and therefore, it is recommended to train him
        from the age of 9 months . When you start training him at the right age, you can achieve impressive results and
        he can become a very disciplined and loyal dog who knows his place in front of the members of the household.
