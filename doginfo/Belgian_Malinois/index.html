        <p> Originally, Belgian shepherd dogs (also called Malinois) were used to guard herds of sheep and cattle as
            well as to perform various jobs.<br> Over the years, they have become guard dogs, probing as well as
            detecting
            explosives.<br> In Israel, for example, they are used by the police and the army, for the purpose of
            guarding
            and locating.

            Dogs of the Belgian shepherd type (Malinois), are actually an "invention" of a Belgian veterinarian named
            Raoul, at the end of the 18th century, who decided to invent a Belgian dog breed. The "creation" process was
            done in the city of Machlen, which in French is called Malin, hence the origin of its name. Apart from this
            type, there are two other types of Belgian Shepherds, the Grundle and Lacanois. Both are named after
            villages in the Brussels city area.

        nose. Some would say that he has a very handsome appearance, elegant, athletic and not bulky. It is similar to
        the German Shepherd, but its body structure is more proportional

        <h3> fur</h3>

        Coat - Belgian shepherd enjoys a medium and smooth coat, but at the same time, a little rough. It includes two
        layers, a hard outer layer and a dense lower layer. The fur provides him with protection against various weather
        conditions. Something that helped him over the years when he was used as a working dog.<br>

        The coat color of a Belgian shepherd is mahogany brown, with black spots on the face and ears. Some dogs have
        white spots on their toes and chest.

        <h2>Character traits of Belgian Malinois Shepherd dogs</h2>
        <p>Belgian shepherd is a working dog and is included in the list of the most common shepherd dogs, but at the
            same time it is very sensitive and loyal, very intelligent and knows how to recognize the mood of its owner.
            You can perform various actions with it and it does not tend to get tired easily. They have a tendency to
            play around and they really enjoy sports activities. It takes time for them to open up to strangers, but
            with time it happens and then they connect with them.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Breeding</strong> - it is important to raise the dog at home and not in the yard or kennel. They can
            be raised at home
            with children and they can also be left alone at home, while you go to work or for anything else, but it is
            important to take them out immediately when you get home.

        <h2>health condition</h2>
        <div class="font">

            <p>A Belgian Malinois is considered a very healthy dog. However, he can deal with joint problems (especially
                if his parents faced a similar problem), skin allergies, as well as vision problems and epilepsy. It is
                rare for these type of dogs to face health problems so they tend to live longer
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <strong>Grooming and hygiene</strong> - it is very important to brush them daily, since they deal with
                significant
                shedding, and the hair, ears and teeth must be cleaned often, so that dirt does not accumulate.
            </p><br>
            <p><strong>Nutrition</strong> - the dog must be provided with dry daily nutrition, preferably paying
                attention to the various
                ingredients, so that he can enjoy healthy and high-quality food. He should be provided with two meals a
                day, morning and evening.
