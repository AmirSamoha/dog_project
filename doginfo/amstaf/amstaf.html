        <h2>Character traits of Amstaff dogs</h2>
        <p>As we mentioned, Amstaff has the image of an aggressive and violent dog. This is why it is also classified by
            the Israeli government (as well as many other governments in the world) as a dangerous dog, and anyone who
            owns an American Amstaff must spay or neuter the dog in order to prevent reproduction.</p><br>
        <p>At the same time, it is important to emphasize, his image often stems from incorrect training and use for
            illegal purposes. Whoever trains, takes care of and raises American Staffordshire Terrier dogs, i.e.
            American Amstaff, correctly, will get to enjoy a very good and well-loved dog.
        </p><br>
        <p>It is true that the Amstaff dog has the qualities of a stubborn, determined and alert dog, but he is also
            very loyal to his owner, curious and smart, and he also has a lot of patience. That's why he also gets along
            very well with other pets as well as people, once he feels comfortable with them
        </p><br>
        <p>An American Amstaff dog, very loyal to his owner, he does not feel the need to be dominant at home and gets
            along great with children. At the same time, because he is considered a dangerous dog according to the
            Israeli Dog Law, it is better not to raise him in apartments but in houses with a yard or garden. There he
            can also express his abilities as a guard dog.

        problems. Some of
        the problems can be treated, while others appear at a later age, due to old age and wear and tear.

        The stage of training is very important for Amstaff dogs. Untrained dogs can be aggressive, to such a degree
        that they may bite people and other dogs. In order to eradicate their sense of aggression and create a proper
        socialization process for them, it is important to take them to a professional trainer at a young age. <br>Among
